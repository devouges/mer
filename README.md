# Middle Earth Remastered Repo

## Notes:
 * SetEditor in \resources\meccgseteditor_windows
 * Note - while this is compatible with normal magicseteditor, you will not get full resolution with the normal one.
   Use the editor here for full resolution support. Regular magicseteditor forces everything down to 150dpi max.
 * Simply run the application from the directory.  Or move it all and run.
 *All game and style files are in the \data\ subdirectory
 * Make sure to install fonts
 * The game files for the data directory are updated often with improvements.
